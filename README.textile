h1. Prettyledo - a nicelooking version of Toodledo

h2. What ?

A stripped down and nicelooking version of the GTD service [Toodledo](http://toodledo.com) based on its API. 

h2. Why ?

Because a lot of people *love* the service when it's used through third party apps, like for instance [Pocket Informant](http://www.pocketinformant.com), but cant use it online due to it's ugly interface. 
(And yes, there are a few [userstyle](http://userstyles.org/styles/browse?search_terms=toodledo&sort=popularity&sort_direction=desc), but even them can't sort out the mess.) My ambition is to make something similar as Pocketinformant but on a web interface.

h2. How?

Well, there's an API. And hopefully I'll get my head around it. Or some smart nerd will come up with a better solution while I'm in development. :)
